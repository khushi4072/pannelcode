It is true that, unlike hotels, hostels can not provide you with a luxury experience but there are five highlighted reasons which will make you fall in love with hostels. One of the perks of staying at a hostel is that it tries to keep a traveller connected to others. In the evening it is quite natural to see many people in the common area sharing their stories and even doing jamming sessions. You can hardly experience these kinds of ambience if you choose to stay in a hotel. Many hostels have a common kitchen area where they help themselves with self-cooked meals which is the most affordable option while travelling. The hostel is not only about affordable stays but also making new friends. A hostel is a place where you will be able to meet new people with whom you can share a different experience. Different people come from different cities, cultures, and languages and it is a great opportunity for travellers, especially for solo ones to experience a diverse cultural mix.Most of the hostel’s host event mainly aims to bring all the travellers together who are staying at the hostel. Such intimate events are very relaxing and are good for networking. These are well-organised group activities where the traveller will contribute their thoughts and make memorable moments."
